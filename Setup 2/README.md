# Setup 2: Scarce signals, with and without SG
In these setups, we have an equal number of states and actions, but few signals. 

`scarce.ipynb` contains two experiments, on a game with 12 states, 2 signals, and 12 actions. Respectively, one uses stimulus generalization and the other does not. 

`circularity.ipynb` contains a game with similar rules, 18 states, 3 signals, and 18 actions. Because there are more than two states, regions are given two borders, creating a 'circular' game. As in the last notebook, this experiment is run twice: once without and once with stimulus generalization.
