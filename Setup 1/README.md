# Setup 1: Predefined Regions and Sender Stimulus Generalization

In `stimgen.ipynb`, you can find the most recent attempt at this setup, inluding recent changes and improvements made to the history object. There are also two folders, `20-2-2 No Equilibrium` and `20-2-2 Automation`, which describe earlier attempts at Setup 1 but have not been updated to the generalized structure. They still contain our progress while Setup 1 was primary, and functions to create a "weights" graph which may be useful for tinkering.
