# basic-signaling-games
Python implementations of Basic Signaling Games proposed by David Lewis

## Experiments
We have proposed 4 different setups. Setup 0 is the basic game proposed by Lewis, and 1-4 are our proposed setups.

* Setup 1: Predefined Regions, Sender Stimulus Generalization

* Setup 2: Scarce signals, with and without Sender SG

* Setup 3: Scarce signals, Sender and Reciever SG

* Setup 4: Expanding the playing field.

Each setup contains it's own README with more detail on its contents, but generally contain a mixture of an updated notebook and our previous checkpoints during development.
