# basic-signaling-games
Python implementations of Basic Signaling Games proposed by David Lewis

### Experiments
I created a notebook for viewing results - like both gifs at once - all in one place, as they're easier to interpret. Physical copies of each GIF will stil be stored like is mentioned below, but the `experiments.ipynb` has up to date methods and explanations.

### GIF Names
GIF name format is {n_states}-{n_actions}-{n_signals}-[Role].gif

For example, 3-3-3-Sender.gif represents a world with 3 states, 3 actions, and 3 signals and displays the Sender's learning history.
